# HorseTpWithMe
This is extreamly outdated, I haven't updated this repo in a very long time.

Maybe I'll update the repo soon with the current HorseTpWithMe Source, or maybe I won't. I haven't decided.

Either way, you can still get the current version of the (compliled) plugin from Spigot (https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/horsetpwithme.8186/) or Bukkit (https://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/horsetpwithme/)
